You will create a class to represent bank accounts and perform fundamental banking operations. The primary objective of this exercise is to practice the definition of classes using a real-life example, specifically, a simple banking system. This exercise aims to familiarize individuals with the concept of class definitions, setting the foundation for subsequent topics in the introduction to digital engineering.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Assignment Description:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will work with a class hierarchy for managing student contact information. You will create classes for generic students and university students, allowing for the storage and retrieval of student data. The aim of this exercise is to enhance our understanding of Superclasses and Subclasses in Python. This foundational knowledge will lay the groundwork for our exploration of more advanced topics in Digital Engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Part 1: Defining the Student Class**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a Python class named `Student` with the following attributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `name` (str): The name of the student.\n",
        "   - `email` (str): The email address of the student.\n",
        "   - `phone` (str): The phone number of the student.\n",
        "\n",
        "   The class should be defined as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Student:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name, email, phone):\n",
        "           \"\"\"\n",
        "           Initializes a Student object.\n",
        "\n",
        "           Parameters:\n",
        "           - name (str): The name of the student.\n",
        "           - email (str): The email address of the student.\n",
        "           - phone (str): The phone number of the student.\n",
        "\n",
        "           This constructor initializes the student's contact information.\n",

        "           # Implementation details here\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Implement the following methods within the `Student` class:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `display_info(self)`: This method prints the student's name, email, and phone number.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `update_email(self, new_email)`: This method allows updating the student's email address.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `update_phone(self, new_phone)`: This method allows updating the student's phone number.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Part 2: Creating University Students**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a Python class named `UniversityStudent` that inherits from the `Student` class. This class represents university students and includes an additional attribute:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `student_id` (str): The unique identifier for the university student.\n",
        "\n",
        "   The `UniversityStudent` class should be defined as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class UniversityStudent(Student):\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name, email, phone, student_id):\n",
        "           super().__init__(name, email, phone)\n",

        "       # Additional methods here (if needed)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create a list to store university student objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Implement the following functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `add_student(student_book, student)`: This function adds a university student to the student book (list).\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `search_student_by_name(student_book, name)`: This function searches for university students in the student book by name and returns a list of matching students.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Part 3: Testing and Display**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Instantiate three `UniversityStudent` objects with the following information:\n",
        "   - Alice Johnson: Email - \"alice.johnson@university.com\", Phone - \"123-456-7890\", Student ID - \"S12345\"\n",

        "2. Add these university students to the student book.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Update the email address of Alice to \"alice.johnson_new_email@university.com\" and the phone number of Charlie to \"555-999-9999\".\n",

        "4. Display all contacts in the student book, including the student ID for university students.\n",
